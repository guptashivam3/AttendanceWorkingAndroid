# attendance-android
Android component for attendance

PART OF THE APP IS IN JAVA(LOGIN PAGE AND REGISTER PAGE)

The project takes a rangers email to sign up
Is connected to firebase/firestore
looks on firestore to see what classes the user is taking
has a profile page that is unaccesible 
has a QR scanner


The project still needs 
To check in to the class and record/look at firebase to see attedance
all of the professor view
blutooth?
finish up profile page
pretty up the recycler view

I think some files need to be put in the git ignore.

For any questions email Caleb at gulbr003@rangers.uwp.edu
